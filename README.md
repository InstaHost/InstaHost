# Instahost (In Development)

Instant is a quick setup tool for generating docker-compose files. The user can select the services they want or presets to help them quickly create media servers, VPNs, and torrents. While much more is planned to be added, I hope to get these created first. This is still under development (solely by me), and if you would like to suggest a new service/feature to be added, we encourage you to create an issue. This repo does acknowledge pull requests; if you want to add a service yourself, create a docker-compose for it!

Planned features:
- Docker Compose generation
- Directory management (create required dirs and manage permissions for them)
- Support for hard linking

**In-depth documentation can be found here:**

Documentation will include the following:
- Quickstart setup
- List of presets to help simplify configuration
- Individual guides for each service
